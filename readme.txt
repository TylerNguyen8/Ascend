Description:
- Game name: Ascent, Venture, Voyage, Vertigo, Elevate, Spire
- Game Inspired by: Celeste
- Similar to what we’ll be making, Celeste is a two-dimensional single-player platform game where the player's only objective is to scale obstacles to reach the top of the mountain. The user is given the ability to run, jump, climb, and dash, and will use their problem solving skills to work their way up.
- The game will be composed of “pixel art” graphics
- The user will use the mouse to navigate any menus
- The user will use the keyboard (arrow keys or WASD) to move, and two other programmable keys to jump and dash
- The game will either be infinite (The player can continue climbing upwards. This will be added if we have extra time) and have a fixed ending. There will be a text file to hold all of the different levels or orientations of obstacles
- As soon as the level starts, a timer will begin and will stop until the user quits are reaches the top (fastest times will be recorded in highscore)
